  <h1>Intelligent Data Assistant (IDA)</h1>
<p>IDA aims to become an all-in-one natural language based interface for Data Science Workflows.
It's core purpose is to ease the task of a Data Scientist by providing a chat interface. At the moment, IDA is capable of handling the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load and display the files of a csv based dataset</li>
<li>Display Bar Graph Visualizations</li>
<li>Display Force-Directed Graph Visualization</li>
<li>Suggest and execute scikit's implementation of clustering algorithms</li>
</ul>
